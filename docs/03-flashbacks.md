# Flashbacks {#flashbacks}

Just briefly.

I have in my mind the way she entered in my class with all those snacks, with a dolphin that stayed hanging from the ceiling for the rest of the year. It was a weird moment for me. It was mid-morning; we were just having class like any other day. Songs, some drawings, some games. Low tables, low chairs. Some reading of that book that I didnâ€™t fully understand. My friends who accompanied me for so many years. That boy, Luis, that used to draw so well already at the age of three and that now has thousands of followers on Instagram. The destiny of all of us was so unwritten. 

My mother entered the class with chips for everyone. Nowadays, poisoning that many kids at once should be banned. At that time, it was probably around the 24th of September of 1996, and I had just become 4 years old. Coming back to the hall of my school feels like travelling back on time. But the universe has relentlessly advance towards this screen, this laptop, and this version of me writing these words. 

She was the woman of my life. My teacher at some point was also the woman of my life. And those girls that we play to catch running on the sand of the courtyard were also the women of my life. I only have a blurred memory of being there, belonging to a mass of many other kids, running behind the same four or five girls. Our scarcity primate unevolved mindset shaped by a society that made male chase women. Enacting truths after only three years of existence.
