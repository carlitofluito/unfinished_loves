["dealer.html", "2 How did it start? The altruist dealer.", " 2 How did it start? The altruist dealer. I went to a techno party next to the canal with a friend called Leri. We roamed around, dance for a bit, and at some point, sit outside of the crowd, to relax for a while. Among many youngsters and hipsters, I saw a guy older than the average dressing a jacket. He was a bit misplaced. But soon, I learn who he was. He went to the side of the stage with a girl. We exchange gazes on the distance. He was selling something to a girl, and I was observing the interaction from the distance. 10 euros, right inner pocket of the jacket. Done. He was the dealer. The girl joined the crowd. The dealer went to the front of the stage looking at the people again, waiting for more customers. We had already acknowledged each other with few smiles and eyes of complicity. He waved at me and made me a gesture to come where he was. I did. While I was walking towards him, he barely had time to reach his pocket and clap my palm putting the pill on my hand. I said, “Thank you”. “It’s 10€”. I thought about giving it back to him and thank him for the offer, but he continued, “But for you it’s free today”. A bit cliché, but real as the home-made tattoos scattered on her uncover body (hands, neck and face). He had probably had a tough past. Immigrant with low opportunities and good social skills. He offered me to go the toilet and do cocaine together, “I invite you” he said. “Not today” I refused, “I want to feel calmer”. He caught me there, “Take only half”. He probably knew that it was the first time I had a pill on my hand. I am 26, and I have never taken cocaine, neither ecstasy, neither many of the popular drugs consumed in techno parties. I didn’t know what was going to come. He told me that if I knew someone interested in ecstasy, I could contact him. I noted his phone number, thanking again for his altruism and generosity. I hugged him and move aside the crowd. "],
["indecision.html", "3 Indecision, ignorance and expectations.", " 3 Indecision, ignorance and expectations. I explained Leri what had just happened. I was doubtful about taken it. Was it the moment? Was it the day? Was it the right people? What will be the effects? “You will dance and fill happy, with a lot of energy.” But that is how I always am. The dealer came next to us, and we had a brief conversation. Standing there, a guy I have talked before approached us and asked whether we knew someone selling “ecstasy”. I don’t know why he asked me but fuck I knew one. I had just met him, and he was standing next to me. I told both to talk with each other. This is what could be considered as synchronicity. In the past, I have only taken weed, alcohol and some minimal amount of other drugs that didn’t affect me much. I am pretty sensitive to almost any substance. That is why I try to avoid them. However, I am curious. Curiosity makes me to like reading and be informed. I have spent most of my life, if not all, learning and studying. Thus, in that situation, I took my smartphone and googled “ecstasy”. I read a short guide while Leri and me were going to buy some water on a shop. Less than an hour ago, I have complained to my friend that I don’t like people that smoke, people that drink, and people that take drugs, but I was on the party, what did I expect? I have seen some people taking ecstasy on the party already, and I didn’t know if that was the right place to be. I even had doubts about being there at all, or not. "]
