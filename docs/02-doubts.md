# Indecision, ignorance and expectations.  {#indecision}

I explained Leri what had just happened. I was doubtful about taken it. Was it the moment? Was it the day? Was it the right people? What will be the effects?

*"You will dance and fill happy, with a lot of energy."* But that is how I always am. 

The dealer came next to us, and we had a brief conversation. Standing there, a guy I have talked before approached us and asked whether we knew someone selling “ecstasy”. I don’t know why he asked me but fuck I knew one. I had just met him, and he was standing next to me. I told both to talk with each other. This is what could be considered as synchronicity.

In the past, I have only taken weed, alcohol and some minimal amount of other drugs that didn’t affect me much. I am pretty sensitive to almost any substance. That is why I try to avoid them.  However, I am curious. 

Curiosity makes me to like reading and be informed. I have spent most of my life, if not all, learning and studying. Thus, in that situation, I took my smartphone and googled “ecstasy”. I read a short guide while Leri and me were going to buy some water on a shop. 

Less than an hour ago, I have complained to my friend that I don’t like people that smoke, people that drink, and people that take drugs, but I was on the party, what did I expect? I have seen some people taking ecstasy on the party already, and I didn’t know if that was the right place to be. I even had doubts about being there at all, or not.
